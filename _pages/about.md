I am currently a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, working with [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/). Before coming to Stanford, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington, and my advisors are [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com/) and [Lalit Jain](http://lalitjain.com/). Prior to that, I received my B.A. in mathematics and computer science at Macalester College.  

My research broadly focuses on developing *simple and interpretable* methods for *optimal decision-making* across domains. I aim to methods that are both *provably optimal* and *practically effective*. More speficially, my work primarily falls in two key areas: optimal exploration in bandit problems and semiparametric efficient estimation, using tools from bandits, semiparametric efficiency, and causal inference. I am also interested in applications to education, online advertising, healthcare and others.

**I am on the job market for positions starting Fall 2026.**
