I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington, working with [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com/) and [Lalit Jain](http://lalitjain.com/). Prior to that, I received my B.A. in mathematics and computer science at Macalester College.  

I'm generally interested in developing high confidence algorithms to identify the optimal rule through adaptive data collection. As examples, the optimal rule could be treatment allocation or targeted recommendations. More specifically, I'm working on bandits, statistical estimation for dependent data as well as designing adaptive algorithms for robust estimation.
