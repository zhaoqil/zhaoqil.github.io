I have been a tutor and the lead tutor for the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. Also, I have been a teaching assistant for the following classes: 
<ul>
    <li>STAT 340: Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics I</li>
    <li>STAT 221: Statistical Concepts and Methods for the Social Sciences</li>
    <li>STAT 529: Sampling Survey Techniques</li>
    <li>STAT 535: Statistical Learning: Modeling, Prediction, and Computing</li>
    <li>STAT 341: Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics II</li>
    <li>STAT 391: Quantitative Introductory Statistics for Data Science</li>
</ul>

I have also led the Directed Reading Program, during which I mentored an undergraduate student on topics in statistics. See below for a description of what we did.
